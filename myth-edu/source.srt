On the VARK website it says,

once you know about VARK, its power to explain things will be a revelation.
它说你一旦知道了这东西 你便知道了如何教别人的惊天秘密

78

But before you take an online learning styles quiz,

it's a good idea to ask, do learning styles even exist?

I mean, do you have one?

83
00:03:38,363 --> 00:03:40,620
where first you would identify learners
首先你先找到一批的不同学习风格的学习者

84
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,800
with at least two different learning styles, say visual and auditory

85
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,840
and then randomly assign learners to one of two educational presentations,

86

one visual, one auditory.
一个视觉教学，一个听觉教学

87
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,700
So for half of the students, the experience will match their learning style

88
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,000
and for the other half it won't.
另外一半则不会

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,930
And then you give everyone the same test.
在此之后给他们一份测试题

90
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,350

the results should show better performance when the presentation

matches the learning style than when they're mismatched.

例如我给（一部分）视觉学习者看了十个事物的图像

96
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,819

because the presentation matched their preferred learning style

00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,790
For example, one looked at visualizers versus verbalizers
他研究的不是视觉或者听觉学习者

144
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,966
instead of visual versus auditory learners.
而是图形学习者和文字学习者

145
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:09,600
The study was computer-based,
这是一个基于计算机的测试

146
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,500
so first students' learning styles were assessed using questions like,
首先这些学生会回答一些问题

147
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,440
would you rather read a paragraph or see a diagram describing an atom?
例如你喜欢看原子的文字还是示意图的描述

148
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,520
The researchers also provided some challenging explanations
研究者还整了一些复杂的介绍

149
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,110
with two buttons, visual help or verbal help.
配上“图形解说”和“文字解说”的两个按钮

150
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,290
The visual one played a short animation
图形解说会放一个小动画

151
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,670
whereas the verbal help gave a written explanation.
文字解说则会弹出一段文字

152
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:30,700
From these measures combined,
通过这些方式

153
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,280
the researchers categorized the students as either visualizers or verbalizers
研究者将这些学生分成了视觉和文字学习者两类

154
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,470
and then the students were randomly assigned
然后将他们随机分配到一个电子电路课堂

155
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,220
to go through a text-based or picture-based lesson on electronics.
这个课堂有文字和图像两种授课方式

156
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,560
When a student hovered their mouse over key words 
当学生把指针悬停在关键词上时

157
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,810
in the lesson in the text-based group, a definition and clarification came up.
文字授课方式的课堂将显示它的定义和解释

158
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,130
But in the picture group,
而图像授课方式的课堂

159
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,780
an annotated diagram was shown instead.
则是显示一个示意图

160
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,710
And after the lesson, the students did a test to assess their learning.
上完课后，测试者发给学生一套测试题来检验学习情况

161
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,000
The students whose preferred learning style matched their instruction
测试结果表明学习的方式与学习风格一致的学生

162
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:05,200
performed no better on the tests than those whose instruction was mismatched.
并没有比不一致的好

163
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,250
The researchers ran the test again with 61 non-college-educated adults
测试者还在 61 个没受过大学教育的学生上做了同样的测试

164
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,364
and found exactly the same result.
结果是一致的

165
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,886
But learning styles are a preference

166
00:07:13,886 --> 00:07:17,710
so how strongly do learners stick to their preference?

167
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,630
Well, in a 2018 study during the first week of semester,

168
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:25,000
over 400 students at a university in Indiana completed the VARK questionnaire

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,100
and they were classified according to their learning style.

170
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,320
Then at the end of the semester

171
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,374
the same students completed a study strategy questionnaire.

172
00:07:32,374 --> 00:07:35,780
So how did they actually study during the term?

173
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,200
Well, an overwhelming majority of students used study strategies

174
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,580
which were supposedly incompatible with their learning style,

175
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,118
and the minority of students who did

176
00:07:44,118 --> 00:07:48,553
did not perform significantly differently on the assessments in the course.

177
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:52,000
The visual auditory reading-writing, kinesthetic or VARK model

178
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,040
came about from Neil Fleming, a school inspector in New Zealand.

179
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,390
Describing the origins of VARK he says,

180
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,000
I was puzzled when I observed excellent teachers who did not reach some learners

181
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,220
and poor teachers who did.

182
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,360
I decided to try to solve this puzzle.

183
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,540
There are, of course, many reasons for what I observed.

184
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,150
But one topic that seemed to hold some magic, some explanatory power,

185
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,850
was preferred modes of learning, modal preferences.

186
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,240
And thus, VARK was born.

187
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,980
There was no study that revealed students naturally cluster into four distinct groups.

188
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,720
Just some magic that might explain

189
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,930
why some teachers can reach students while others can't.

190
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,430
But how can this be?

191
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,650
If we accept that some people are more skilled

192
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:35,960
at interpreting and remembering certain kinds of stimuli

193
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,659
than others like visual or auditory,

194
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:43,599
then why don't we see differences in learning or recall with different presentations?

195
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,480
Well, it's because what we actually want people to recall

196
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,010
is not the precise nature of the images or the pitch or quality of the sound.

197
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,212
It's the meaning behind the presentations.

198
00:08:53,212 --> 00:08:57,520
There are some tasks that obviously require the use of a particular modality.

199
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,180
Learning about music, for example, should have an auditory component.

200
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,055
Similarly, learning about geography will involve looking at maps.

201
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:09,310
And some people will have greater aptitude to learn one task over another.

202
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:13,830
Someone with perfect pitch, for example,

203
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,830
will be better able to recall certain tones in music.

204
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:15,820
Someone with excellent visual-spatial reasoning

205
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,870
will be better at learning the locations of countries on a map.

206
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,930
But the claim of learning style theories is that

207
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:24,792
these preferences will be consistent across learning domains.

208
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:29,157
The person with perfect pitch should learn everything better auditorily

209
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:31,780
but that is clearly not the case.

210
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,633
Most people will learn geography better with a map.

211
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,910
Review articles of learning styles consistently conclude

212
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:43,030
there is no credible evidence that learning styles exist.

213
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,000
In a 2009 review, the researchers note,

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,100
the contrast between the enormous popularity

215
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,630
of the learning styles approach within education

216
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,060
and the lack of credible evidence for its utility is,

217
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,250
in our opinion, striking and disturbing.

218
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:00,200
If classification of students' learning styles has practical utility,

219
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,870
it remains to be demonstrated.

220
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,210
- What we're expecting is, if your style was honored

221
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:08,320
you're going to perform better than if

222
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,880
you had some experience that conflicted with your style.

223
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,730
And this is where we don't see any support for the learning styles theory.

224
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,581
- One of the reasons many people find learning styles

225
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:21,720
so convincing is because they already believe it to be true.

226
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,500
For example, they might already think that they're a visual learner,

227
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,000
and then when a teacher shows them a diagram of, say, a bike pump

228
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,920
and suddenly the concept clicks,

229
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,310
well, they interpret this as evidence for their visual learning style.

230
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,810
- You already believe that learning styles is right.

231
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,600
When you have an experience the first think you think is,

232
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,260
is that in some way consistent with learning styles?

233
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,830
And if it is, you don't think further.

234
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,000
- When in reality that diagram

235
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,240
might just be a great diagram that would have helped anyone learn.

236
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,230
When we already believe the world to be a certain way,

237
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:55,690
then we interpret new experiences to fit with those beliefs

238
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,908
whether they actually do or not.

239
00:10:57,908 --> 00:11:02,440
So if learning styles don't improve learning, then what does?

240
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,500
Well, there's a large body of literature that supports the claim that

241
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,330
everyone learns better with multimodal approaches

242
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,980
where words and pictures are presented together

243
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,600
rather than either words or pictures alone.

244
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,090
Now there's gonna be words as well as the picture.

245
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,060
We're gonna see if this is any better.

246
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,500
This is known as the multimedia effect,

247
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,430
and it explains in part, at least,

248
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,220
why videos can be such powerful tools for learning

249
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,920
when the narration complements the visuals.

250
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,013
Duck.
- Duck.

251
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:31,720
- Heart.
- Heart.

252
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,140
- In my PhD research, I found explicit discussion of misconceptions was essential

253
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,830
in multimedia teaching for introductory physics.

254
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,050
- How many is that?
- Six.

255
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,030
- Six, okay, that's good.

256
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,490
- That is a whole 50% better.

257
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,948
Do you think that was easier?

258
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:47,980
- Yeah, yeah, 100%, 100%.
- Yeah, with the words, yeah.

259
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,214
- Ultimately, the most important thing for learning

260
00:11:50,214 --> 00:11:52,980
is not the way the information is presented

261
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,990
but what is happening inside the learner's head.

262
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:59,000
People learn best when they're actively thinking about the material,

263
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,010
solving problems or imagining what happens if different variables change.

264
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,290
I talked about how and why we learn best

265
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,690
in my video, "The Science of Thinking" so check that out.

266
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:14,220
Now, the truth is, there are many evidence-based teaching methods that improve learning.

267
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,810
Learning styles is just not one of them.

268
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:21,830
And it is likely, given the prevalence of the learning styles misconception

269
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,210
that it actually makes learning worse.

270
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,800
I mean, learning styles give teachers unnecessary things to worry about,

271
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:32,650
and they make some students reluctant to engage with certain types of instruction.

272
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,600
And all the time and money spent on learning styles and related training

273
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,180
could be better spent on interventions that actually improve learning.

274
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:45,200
You are not a visual learner nor an auditory learner nor a kinesthetic learner,

275
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,400
or more accurately, you are all these kinds of learner in one.

276
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,470
The best learning experiences are those

277
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,620
that involve multiple different ways of understanding the same thing.

278
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:03,435
And best of all, this strategy works not just for one subset of people but for everyone.
